## A little about me
- My favorite colors are orange and blue
- I like to play table tennis, tennis and a bit of soccer, but not so much for American football
- I'm a camping person, not really a beach person
- ...

Ok I don't like talking about myself too much so there won't be much here (for now), but I will keep this page updated as I come up with more interesting things to tell. I'm currently in my 3rd year as a Computer Engineer major, dreaming to become an **Embedded Firmware Developer**, and if possible even **Digital Hardware Design** (actually designing the "microprocessors" instead of just writing the codes for them, think of the small chips in your laptop). I think just coding alone without knowing the metals you're working with is very boring, which is why I am very interested in learning the hardware side of computers. I spent a good chunk of my free time messing around with old phones and laptops, trying to understand how they even work, yet I feel like I barely scratch the surface. I have probably looked at so many laptops in recent years that I can tell what laptop it is just by looking at its inside.

## Why I want to study the metals
My dream is that by the time I graduate, I will be able to identiy and fix the dead dGPU inside my [old laptop](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Flaptopmedia.com%2Flaptop-specs%2Fdell-g5-15-5587-4%2F&psig=AOvVaw32-KgJqN8ZxjMtJVBY7iXe&ust=1664845801459000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAwQjRxqFwoTCPj464XwwvoCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE). I feel like I still have a long way to go, since I still need to learn how to:

- [ ] Solder new components onto the board (and obtain enough money to buy soldering tools)
- [ ] Interpret the board's original schemantic (if I ever manage to get my hand on it)
- [ ] Learn and install Linux (so I get better control over the driver)
- [ ] Using my circuit analysis skill to identify the component that went bad
- [ ] Read and able to understand Nvidia's GPU kernel code

&nbsp;
## Programming languages I have experience with
- C/C#/C++ (my favorites)
- Java
- HTML (yes the 1.0)
- Python
- Assembly
&nbsp;

## Programming languages I want to try out:
- [ ] Swift (for Apple's sake)
- [ ] Javascript/SQL

## Projects I'm working on
I don't have anything going on right now so here is a picture of me horseback riding during the summer as placeholder:
